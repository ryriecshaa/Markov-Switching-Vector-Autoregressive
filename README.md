## MARKOV SWITCHING VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE USING R

This research employs the MSVAR model to analyze regime changes in Sharia banking financing data. The model accurately identifies economic conditions such as crisis, stability, and boom periods, facilitating strategic decision-making and effective policy development in the Sharia banking sector.

Key Points:

Research Objective: Utilizing MSVAR to accommodate regime changes in Sharia banking financing data. Methodology: Testing for stationarity, determining optimal lags, addressing heteroskedasticity, Granger causality, cointegration, correlation, and regression using time series data indicators like DPKS, ROAS, FDR, GDP, INFLATION, BI7DRR, USD, and M2. Findings: The MSVAR model with 4 regimes yielded optimal AIC (-665.19), BIC (-455.48), and log-likelihood (364.59) values, accurately classifying data into crisis, boom, and stable categories compared to other regime counts. Implications: The model provides deep insights into economic dynamics, identifies significant patterns and trends not observable through other methods, and supports strategic decision-making and policy development in the Sharia banking sector. Keywords: MSVAR, Regime, Overfitting, Heteroskedasticity
